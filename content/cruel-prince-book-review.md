"The Folk of the Air" is a young adult, fantasy trilogy written by Holly Black which follows the story of the seventeen-year old mortal girl Jude. Book one of the installation ‘The Cruel Prince’ (2018), begins with the tragic past surrounding Jude and her siblings. Jude was seven years old when her parents were murdered in cold blood. Following this tragedy, along with her two sisters, there were forced to live in Elfhame, High Court of Faerie by her stepfather who also happens to be the murderer responsible for her parent's death. He turns out to be the biological father of Jude's elder sister Vivienne (vivi) and the grand general of the high court of Faerie.
Left with no choice, Jude and her twin sister Taryn adapt themselves to life in Elfhame. They develop a liking to Madoc and are compelled to somewhat accept him as a father against their better judgement. Vivi, on the other hand, rebels against living in Elfhame, showcasing her hatred to Madoc at every chance she gets. Being mortals, Jude and her twin soon realize their challenges in this twisted reality of their new home. They try not to draw too much attention to themselves in the hopes of not being the target of faerie classmates in their bullying schemes fueled by their collective hatred of mortals. The readers are introduced to the four influential classmates namely Cardan, Nacasia, Locke and Valerian.

 Jude makes it her life's mission to prove her worth in Elfhame and to get the upper hand against her archenemy Prince Cardan who makes her life miserable. As a matter fact, the title "Cruel Prince" points mostly at Cardan, but as the story progresses, the title takes a new meaning as it implicitly points to the princes of the royal court outmatching the other in terms of evilness.
The protagonist lets herself be vulnerable in her narrative. Only the readers have an inkling of her true emotions of fear and terror. The narrative explores the intricacy of emotions which makes for complex characters. The protagonist is always plotting and even cunning at times. The book does not shy away from exploring the twisted emotions of the flawed characters such as Madoc's. He is ruthless at times and keeps fluctuating between family and duty. The tragic beginning points him to be the prime villain but is not always portrayed as such. As for Cardan, one goes from resenting him to understanding him. We observe how the characters transform over the course of the novel for better or worse.

> Faerie might be beautiful, but it's beauty is like a golden stag's carcass, crawling with maggots beneath his hide, ready to burst

The author Holly Black builds a world, that is rich in imagery, bringing imaginable things to life. It is terrifyingly beautiful in its narrative. There’s a mix of intrigue and fear at every turn of the story. Conniving and conspiring characters fight for authority, discovering and manipulating the most guarded secrets. The story also explores the feeling of belonging and it is different for every character. for Taryn, it is through marriage alliance to a faerie, for Jude it is through status and power. It is not a light-hearted book, its dark and cruel at times, with monsters lurking in the woods of Elfhame. Jude is not the run of the mill protagonist. She is cunning at times, often engaging in strategic, implacable planning. The goal of the protagonist Jude is to gain power, which according to her could be obtained through Knighthood. She is determined to prove it to her father that she has what it takes to be a knight. Gradually, she realizes that ultimately, she needs more than that to gain freedom and respect and truly be accepted in the High Court of Faerie.
