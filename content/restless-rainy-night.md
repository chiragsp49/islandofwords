I open my eyes to pitch black darkness. A rustling sound comes from my bedroom window. Judging by the soft glow of moonlight floating through the curtains, it must have been 1 or 2' o clock in the morning. Abruptly, woken up from sleep, I try to get up in unhurried movements, careful not to move my old bones too much. It takes me a while to locate my glasses on the shelf and turn on the bed lamp. 
 
The soft glow of the lamp illuminates the wedding picture on the nightstand. I make eye contact with Gita's smiling frozen face for a moment.  
 
I have been here in this house for less than a week. But the memories go long back. Lazy afternoons with our children playing cricket out in the yard or relaxing in the rocking chairs reading a book with the view of the rose garden.   
 
My wife Gita used to do gardening when the weather turned cool. I have been more of an indoor person; I spent my time teaching or reading. But ever since I retired, I find myself wanting to spend less time at home. A restless feeling sets in. Ever since Gita passed away a year ago, the walls of the house keep closing in a little more each day. 
 
After the first decade of living in this town, we made the transition to go live in the city. Now that I turned 70 years old, I felt the strongest urge to come back to this house again. Thankfully, the house is in good condition as a result of being rented by different families and renovated over the years. 
 
There! It’s that ruffling sound again. It's the third night that I have been disturbed from sleep. Added to that, with my insomnia, I hardly got a wink of sleep this week. I carefully make my way to the doorstep. The light bulb in the balcony has not yet been replaced. I try not to stumble as I carefully climb down the stairs.  
 
The streetlight casts a dim glow over the night. I peer through the darkness toward the mango trees across the front yard. The batches gave an eerie look like that of skeleton hands swinging in the moonlight. The wind continues howling, signaling an impending thunderstorm. The branches make creaking sounds, dangerously swaying to the force of the wind. 
 
‘Crack, crack’, I hear a sound and turn toward the direction of the trees lining the other side of the street. It resembles the sounds dried leaves make when being stepped on. I follow the sound toward the base of a mango tree, the biggest one, on the other side of the mud road, in front of my house.  

The sight of the enormous trunk never fails to amaze me. When we first bought this property, there was no road in front of the house, instead, vast areas of land were covered with greenery. At that time, there were many mango trees scattered around, barely four feet tall. Some of them survived and thrived in a rather flourishing manner. Gita used to remark that we would have a beautiful forest in front of the house in a couple of years. During our time here, these trees have gradually grown to the size of two-storey buildings.  
 
Now at the center, a huge mango tree has taken up residence, surrounded by two rather smaller mango trees. The canopy of the massive tree in the center interconnected by the other trees, gives the illusion of the green ceiling floating over the head. 

How a tiny plant half of my size grows up to become huge like a tower still baffles me. I walk around it, looking for the source of sound. The fallen leaves sway and scatter on the ground as though they are trying to match in time with the rhythm of the wild. Other than that, nothing seems amiss. I listen closely and look around once more for anything unusual.  
 
I trace my way back to the house guided by the moonlight. The crescent moon resembles a smiling mouth in the cloudy starless sky. I slow down and gaze up at the dense branches almost covering up the sky. Moonlight streams from the gaps within the leaves, taking the form of a canvas intricately created by black and white shades of shadows and tiny beams of light. 

I stand mesmerized by the sight. How have I never seen this before? I didn't realize it would look so beautiful in the night. The darkness makes me appreciate the tiny glimmer of light more. It draws my attention and makes me realize that there’s beauty amidst the shadows. 
 
All of a sudden, it starts to drizzle, lightning flashes through the sky. The skies open up, resulting in heavy downpour. I make my way back. 
A carefree laugh bubbles up my chest. I feel like a kid again at 70. The smell of the first rain permeates through the house. It reminds me of ice candies that I had as a kid in the summer after running around playing in the field.  
 
After turning off the balcony lights, I take my glasses off and lie down for the night. Finally sleep finds me. 
 
The bright light against my eyelids wakes me up. Light spills from the open curtain radiating warmth. The slight coolness in the air lingers as a reminder of the rain yesterday. 
 
The morning passes by in a blur. The dragon flies zoom around in their meandering patterns in the yard, dew drops cling to blades of grass, 
Sun rises, and the world is born anew again. The pattern is the same, but its uniqueness lies in the shades of the sky, in the ripples of water in the pond, in the growth of a new fruit. 
 
Everyday felt the same, but not today. I feel the change in the air.  
 
To escape the stifling afternoon heat, I venture out to the gardens. 
I sense something swizz past in the air toward one of the branches. 
A group of children hurdle small rocks aiming at a bunch of mangoes. One cleverly aimed rock hits the target, and the kids cheer. A smile comes upon my face thinking of my summer days spent under the mango tree with my family. The mangoes wobble precariously but does not part with the tree.  
 
Hearing my approach, the kids turn and begin to run.  
"Wait kids, don't run, you might get hurt.”
Some of the kids stop running, noticing the fact that I am not an authoritarian figure here to scold them.

They hesitate and look at me cautiously. 
"Did you manage to get any mangoes?", I ask. 
When they realize I am not angry at them for throwing stones at the mango tree, they appear to relax more. 
"Yes, we got two mangoes!" 
"It was one of my throws that gave us two mangoes at once!” 
I laugh at their answers.
"Good, good! You can come tomorrow, I'll see whether I’ll be able to get a hook, that way you could get many more mangoes!" 
The kids chatter excitedly themselves and eventually run off probably to play another game before the dark sets in. 
 
The next morning, after a steamy cup of morning chai, I go in search of the hook. I eventually find it nestled against corner of the wall of my car shed. I clean the cobwebs and dirt from the hook, as I walk towards the line of trees. The chirping of the birds goes in time with the rustle of the leaves drifting in the morning cool breeze. 

I look up at the mango tree, the sight reminds of the children yesterday. I see two water bottles lying on the grass nearby. I wonder who the tree has beckoned today. 
 
A teenage girl and her younger brother sit on a rock and wait patiently for the mangoes to fall. They are the children of my next-door neighbours. 
 
They stand up and greet me warmly.   
I look up when the trees sway gently to the wind, not enough for any mangoes to fall. 
“How long have you been waiting?”  
The boy glances at his watch for a long time, and remarks, “For about half an hour now”.  
 
Curious about this tad bit of information, I enquire whether they have been here before. They admit that it’s what they do during their summer vacation. Their mother makes them lemon juice and they wake up early and sit here, sipping the juice from their bottles. They admit that not many of the previous tenants approved of the neighborhood children coming here and playing across their yard. 
 
Hmm, now that explains the instance of the children running yesterday.
I plan to rectify the situation immediately so that the children don’t feel unwelcome anymore. 
 
With the new-found hook, we attempt to make the mangoes fall from the trees.
"Grandpa, look out!" 
I step out of the way as soon as possible, as the mangoes caught in the hook, come hurdling downwards. 
Soon, it becomes a fun game as the siblings laugh, as I avoid missing the mangoes falling close my head.  
As the sun's rays gets more heated, the siblings head back, jostling the heavy bag pack between them filled with ripe mangoes. 
 
Completely spent, and with heaving breaths I walk slowly towards home and sit on the rocking chair on the veranda none so gently. 
Listening to the ever-present familiar sound of the nature, unknown to me, my eyes slowly shut and drift off to a restful nap. 


“Tap, tap." 
I open my eyes. A feeling of deija va occurs, recalling the sound I heard two days ago. 
The smell of Earth cling to the grass, dragonflies mill around in arid circles, dancing to their own dance. 
Curious about the mystery sound, I follow it like a bee drawn to the light. 
As I near the base of the tree, the sound gets louder. 

Almost instantly realization strikes, kittens? 

The sounds almost sound like that of a human baby, it tugs at my heartstrings. 
On closer inspection, I find three kittens milling around at the underbrush. The mother cat watches me closely within a few metres away. Once she learns that I am no longer a threat, she settles down the grass keeping a close watch on them. 
In the distance, along with the sounds of the occasional vehicles, the wind also carries voices of the children chatting and laughing as they play in the ground nearby. The mud sticks to my bare feet, I look up and see the mango tree as though reaching to the clear cloudless sky, bearing fruits, and providing shade to countless creatures over the decades. 

It's able to withstand the forces of nature, swaying wildly but surviving amidst raging storms. 
I have not dealt with loss and change easily. A sense of helplessness, the thought of not being able to do anything about any situation has been an ever-present feeling in my life.

But here in this place, I want to let go. 
Like leaves drifting in the wind, my worries float away. I always liked the rainy days more than the sunny ones. It is as though the world is in transition. It’s unpredictable but you know with certainty, you will come out at the other side to clear skies.  

I feel a strange sense of connection to the trees. Breathing in the humid air, a mindfulness settles over me and hope unfurls within me.
