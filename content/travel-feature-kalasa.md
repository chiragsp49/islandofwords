The cool morning breeze carried whispered promises of the mystic beauty of nature. In the early morning light, we watched the ‘Bhadra’ river flow leisurely under the bridge. The sun hit our faces and warmed our chilly hands.

We then drove in a rustic jeep along the rocky, winding path enclosed by a plethora of coffee plantation with the smell of Earth in the air. The city ‘Kalasa’ (in Chikkamagaluru district, Karnataka) is surrounded by mountains and with its lush forests, it appeared to be wrapped in a green blanket. The trail came to an abrupt stop with bushes obstructing our view. Beyond those bushes, hid a majestic waterfall. We stared at it in disbelief. It was called ‘Abugudige Falls’. The blue green water held an ethereal glow which reflected off shiny glass rocks. It felt more amazing to experience that beauty up close. We had a South Indian breakfast of ‘idli’ and’ vada’ by the side of the stream. With the resounding rhythm of the waterfall, it was by far the best breakfast I had. Of course, the food was good too.

Later we continued our travel along another steep mountain road towards ‘Maidhady’ high point. As the jeep climbed higher and higher the mountain, our excitement grew tenfold. Our travel guide drove the jeep right to the top of the mountain, the edge of the cliff could be seen just a few metres away. We lifted our eyes from the terrifying edge and stared mesmerised at the landscape beyond it. The fog covered the steep mountains like a cloak. We could see the whole of ‘Kalasa’ spread out like a canvas right in front of our eyes.

We were informed that ‘Kalasa’ is known for its countless waterfalls. We wholeheartedly agreed to visit another waterfall at noon. This ‘yelaneeru’ waterfall was located in the reserve forests close to an estate of an ex-military man who was our guide for the trek. We trekked along a steep path which was situated adjacent to the huge waterfall. We were a group of at least twenty people. Towards the very end, we were all crawling with our hands and knees to reach the top. Due to rainfall in the past couple of days, the soil was slippery. The paramount reason for the success of our climb was our ex-military guide. We learnt a lot about the terrain, like to never step on the rocks because apparently they are more slippery than mud. The journey was worth it when we reached the centre of the waterfall. Sadly, we couldn’t take any close -up pictures of the falls since none of our phones were water-proof so we had to leave those behind. The water fell over our head with a force that made breathing difficult. It then continued to flow through another steep cliff (from where we were standing), along a vertical path like stairs. The waterfall looked never ending as we could not see the bottom of it from our vantage point between tilted jarred rocks. We sat on those rocks and the cold water hit our backs. After a while, our bodies adjusted to the temperature and the water felt warm against our skin. The insistent beat of the water was believed to have curing properties for back aches. It was a bliss to be under nature’s natural shower. It was as if we were one with nature, as though we were connected soul and body.
