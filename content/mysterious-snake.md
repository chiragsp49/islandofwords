This incident occurred when I was about eight years old. In the hot humid breeze, during the most awaited summer vacation, my older sister, cousin and I were playing ‘kitchen and house’ on the veranda. We were home alone. It was a traditional house with many dark cave-like small rooms. It had a huge front-yard lined with coconut trees, mango trees and shrubs. We had expertly arranged the kitchen set on top of the handle rail and were seated beside it. As we were happily playing that little game of ours, we heard the sound of crackling leaves in the distance. Not finding it suspicious, we ignored it and jovially continued our game. As we were arranging the kitchen utensils for a tea party, the sound was distinctly heard again and only grew louder with time. Ignoring no more, we then whipped our head around just in time to see a huge snake crawling through the shrubs making its way to the veranda! It was black in colour and a few feet long. Now when I think about it, the snake was probably a grown rat snake but at that time, we were scared out of our minds assuming its poisonous. On seeing the snake, my cousin very smartly leapt from the veranda, ran towards the door of the house and disappeared inside. My sister and I were too stunned to move! By the time we came to our senses, the reptile had almost reached the veranda and was making its way to where we stood, ready to bolt. We had no other choice but to run towards the compound since the snake blocked our way to the door. My sister and I ran for our lives screaming for help at the top of our lungs! We reached the gate while the snake was still slowly making its way up the veranda. We were still screaming even though the snake was nowhere near us. Hearing our cries for help, the neighbours fearing something was terribly wrong, hurriedly came to our rescue. By that time, my sister and I were hysterically crying and pointing towards the veranda. The kind neighbours went to inspect the place in search of the snake. To our surprise, the snake had disappeared! Much to our embarrassment, we had attracted a large crowd through our screaming. Even after a few hours’ people were still milling around the house looking for the mysterious snake! We stood in stunned silence due to utter mortification!
