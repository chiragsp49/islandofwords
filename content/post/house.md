Brick by brick,a house is built,  
welcomed by familarity and concrete walls.  
Dreams scattered in the echoes of footprints.  
Seasons change, memories of a time gone by.  
Within the gaps between tiles,  
veins in the wall, a crack in the window glass;  
Winter sets into the dark recesses of my mind.  
Some unknown, forgotten emotion;  
loneliness, dare I name it, making its presence known.
