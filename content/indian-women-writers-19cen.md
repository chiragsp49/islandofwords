The following blog posts highlights the perspectives of women on the social reform movements of colonial India, by examining the works of fiction by women writers Swarnakumari Debi (1856-1932), Kashibai Kanitkar(1861- 1948), Krupabai Sattianadan( 1862-1894) and Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain (1880-1932). In the backdrop of the nationalist and reform movements, the women writing of the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century is unique as it offered a subjective position thereby enabling the readers to view them as potential political activists instead of limiting them to being mere subjects of reform. The uniqueness of women writings could be seen in its potential to position the personal within the larger picture of the political sphere. The works provided the women’s perspective on reform movements as it depicted lived experiences. It revealed female agency digressing from being only the subject matter as conceptualized and imagined by male reformists. 

The posts will conduct close reading of the selected works from the decades 1890’s to 1920’s, keeping in mind the aspect of realism as these works were written amid the mounting tensions of national movement of the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. My contribution is to expand this field of study by examining particular instances of female agency and the emerging community building of women in connection with the social reform activities in works of fiction by the women writers Swarnakumari Debi Ghosal (1856-1932), Kashibai Kanitkar(1861- 1948), Krupabai Sattianadan( 1862-1894) and Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain (1880-1932). The writing reveals the formation of community building among women giving rise to the bonds of sisterhood and the emerging companionship among them. It points to the awareness of the deep-rooted cultural prejudice of the society and their subsequent rejection of it. By the process of claiming their identity, they take charge of their life by exercising individual choice and freedom without male interference.  By resisting against expected societal roles, they challenge the notion of fate wherein suffering is taken as a woman’s lot in life. In their writing, there existed a sense of self-realization which in turn led to resistance and the demand for change. Resistance took the form of expression in literature and the writers attempted to reinvent the identity of a new woman based on lived experiences. The writing depicts the radical departures from the societal expected role of women. It reveals the inner workings of the private sphere by taking the personal and domestic as central issues of interest. The ‘woman’s language' in literary works, draws attention to the uniqueness of female experiences, emotions and concerns, thereby alleviating them from the status of passive subjects or second-class citizens to that of potential political activists.
