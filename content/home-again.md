It has been a long time, way too long to remember. The house still looks the same but with minor changes.
Windows are withered and the paint looks like it will peel off any moment. I recall the garden which was painstakingly maintained by mother is now turned into a wild forest. A house surrounded by thorns just like my heart. Seven long, lonely years would do that to a house.
I stand looking at the house in the hot humid weather, but I don’t feel the heat. Oddly, it feels cold. There’s a lump in my throat. I wait for the tears to come which does not make an appearance. I don't know whether to weep or laugh. I am finally home but it’s not home anymore.

"Naina, do you want to look inside?”, mom enquires with a smile. I can see she is concerned about me. It’s my first-time being home after that tragic night. All I see in my mind's eye is that night. It is embedded in my memory forever, the night when dad did not return home. It was the last we saw of this house. It gave a lot, but we lost a lot more.

"Yes, let us go and look inside. I want to see what's changed".
We make our way through the weeds where once stood a proud rose garden. It shouldn't have ended this way, but it has come down to this. Selling the house is our last resort.

"We don't have to make a decision now", mom says with a faraway look. She misses dad as much as I do. Probably much more than I can comprehend.

"You know we have to. Avni doesn't even want to see the house. She’s so adamant about not selling the house either. I fail to understand her. She has to make a decision.”

"Your sister is still shaken. Give her some time".

"It’s been seven years. We can't give her more time!”

Mom looks solemn. Avni is younger than me by four years and seven months. I am now twenty-one. She is fiercely independent that she refuses to stay with us.
She was barely nine when it happened. Maybe it is her way of dealing with her grief.
Our time with dad has been cut short. There’s ten years of memory in this house. It’s much more than bricks and pillars. I am not the same person anymore. I am too afraid to walk through the doors. Would I still remember every moment or forget everything like a tide which washes away everything and anything in its path leaving only bits and pieces? Selling the house will make it easy. We do not have maintain it anymore. That is what we tell ourselves. Eventually we have come to believe that lie .It seems bizarre now.
I can’t remember the last time I have been genuinely happy, so happy that you have nothing to think about that would bring tears to your eyes, no regrets and certainly no guilt. What if I stopped dad before he went on that drive? What if that truck which hit his car wasn’t on the road at the time? What if dad had survived like everyone else in the accident. What ifs never end. The ability to forget is the best healing mechanism we human beings have.
Walking through the house after seven long years is not what I expected to feel like. I am…happy!  I am filled with a feeling that everything will be alright now, a closure. Is this what acceptance feels like? Is this what Avni is afraid to feel? Is the feeling mutual? I look over at mom and she has tears in her eyes. The thought of selling the house is doing this to her. Why did I ever think selling the house will solve our dilemma? That it can make me forget. I was terribly wrong.
“Mom, you were right. I think we should give it a shot. Living here will be good for us.”
Mom similes and looks over me with tears streaming down her cheeks.
“I hope those are tears of joy,” I say cracking a wry smile and interlock our fingers together.
We continue our inspection of the house. We discuss what need not be changed instead of what needs to be changed. We decide not to rush our decision this time instead take one step at a time and leave the rest to take its course. I have no doubt that Avni will eventually come around and stick with our decision to live like a family once again. But we will not rush her. It was not the house which needed to be fixed but our broken hearts which needed to be healed. We cannot rush our hearts to decide. We do not control that. The heart wants what it wants and also when it wants.
